Abstract—Blind modulation classification problem is partic
ularly difficult when the exact frequency band of the signal
is unknown since the modulation classifiers require accurate
estimates of the signal parameters such as center frequency,
bandwidth, and SNR. In this work, we demonstrate a hierarchical
classification tree that filters and classifies a received signal
as AM, FM, 4/16/64-QAM, 2/4/8-PAM, 4/8/16-PSK, DSSS, and
FSK. Coarse estimates of signal parameters are obtained from
energy detection and are refined using cyclostationary estima
tors. Cumulants and cyclostationarity are used to classify AM
and FM while a reduced complexity Kuiper test is used for
differentiating modulation level for QAM, PAM, and PSK. The
effects of multipath are countered using a blind equalizer. The
classifier is implemented in C++ using GNURadio libraries and
is demonstrated using a USRP N210.
